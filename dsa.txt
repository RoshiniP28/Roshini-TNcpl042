Question: What is a linked list? Answer: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object and each element (node) points to the next one in the sequence.
Question: What are the advantages of a linked list over an array? Answer: Linked lists have dynamic size, efficient insertion and deletion operations, and no need for contiguous memory allocation like arrays.
Question: What are the different types of trees in data structures? Answer: Some common types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees.
Question: What is a stack and how does it work? Answer: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It has two main operations: push (to add an element to the top) and pop (to remove the top element).
Question: How do you implement a queue using stacks? Answer: One way to implement a queue using stacks is to use two stacks. One stack is used for enqueue operations, and the other is used for dequeue operations.
Question: What is recursion in algorithms? Answer: Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It's commonly used in algorithms like factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence generation, and tree traversal.
Question: What is the time complexity of binary search? Answer: The time complexity of binary search is O(log n) because it halves the search space in each step.
Question: What are the characteristics of dynamic programming? Answer: Dynamic programming is characterized by solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. It often involves overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
Question: What is the purpose of hashing in data structures? Answer: Hashing is used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. It's commonly used for data retrieval and storage in hash tables, where keys are mapped to array indices using a hash function.
Question: What are some common sorting algorithms? Answer: Some common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
