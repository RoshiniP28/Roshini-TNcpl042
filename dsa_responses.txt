Some common types of trees include binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees.
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It has two main operations: push (to add an element to the top) and pop (to remove the top element).
One way to implement a queue using stacks is to use two stacks. One stack is used for enqueue operations, and the other is used for dequeue operations.
Recursion is a technique where a function calls itself to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It's commonly used in algorithms like factorial calculation, Fibonacci sequence generation, and tree traversal.
The time complexity of binary search is O(log n) because it halves the search space in each step.
Dynamic programming is characterized by solving problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and solving each subproblem only once. It often involves overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure.
Hashing is used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values. It's commonly used for data retrieval and storage in hash tables, where keys are mapped to array indices using a hash function.
Some common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
Stoichiometry is the calculation of quantities of substances involved in chemical reactions based on the balanced equation. It involves determining the molar ratios of reactants and products, and calculating the amounts of substances consumed or produced.
